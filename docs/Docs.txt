HOW TO USE

When you open the program you are presented with an editor.
YOu can type your own code into the box and press run to execute it.
The editor doesn't function entirely like a normal multi-line text box 
because of the difficulty of coding one. Fun Fact: a good rich text editor is really
hard to program because of problems like wrapping,sizing,scrolling,etc...

You can also open a variety of sample programs that I have collected. 

Click the Tour button in the editor to learn more.
